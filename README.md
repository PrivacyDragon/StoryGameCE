# StoryGameCE

This is a game where you have to make a story with the words you get. It's based on Storycubes.

##### Important gamerules:
-You can interpret a word in many different ways. (That's one of the nice things about this game)
-Every story is correct. It doesn't matter if it's logical or not, everything is correct.

You can easily send the program to your calculator using TiLP or TI-connect CE.
Once you've sent it to your calculator there are two possible options to run the program:
-If the OS of your calculator is 5.5 or higher, then you should run the program via Cesium, or use asmhook.
-If the OS of your calculator is 5.4 or below, you can just run the program via the [prgm] menu.

#### IMPORTANT:
To be able to run this program, you also need the C-libraries installed.
You can find them at: https://tiny.cc/clibs

##### Main idea of the program:
Once you run the program, sixteen words will be generated (*Pseudo-randomly taken from a list of hundred words). With this words you should make a story, and you might interpret the words in any possible way.
An important rule is that every story is correct. there are isn't any wrong story.
You can play the game in any way you like; You can make a story individually, but in a small group you can also do that everyone has to add something to the story so that someone begins with doing something with a word, then the next one goes further on it with another word, and then the next one does the same and so on.

##### Controls:
press: <br/>
-<code>[alpha]</code> to generate new words.<br/>
-<code>[clear]</code> to exit

To put a word in the column on the right, you should press the number of the field you want it in.
But, important: if you want to set something in the first field, you should press [1],[enter].
If you do not press enter after the 1, it will wait for you to input another number!

Very much thanks to everyone who helped and especially to MateoC!
